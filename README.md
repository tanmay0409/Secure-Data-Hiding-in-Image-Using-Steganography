# StegoCrypt-Image-Steganography-Tool
A Python-based image steganography tool that hides and retrieves secret messages in images using pixel manipulation. It supports separate encryption and decryption processes with a passcode for security. Built with OpenCV, this project is great for learning steganography, cryptography, and image processing.
